This document answers all questions from the Agile Ceremonies & Team Collaboration task.

## 🔍 Research & Learn

### **1. What are the main Agile ceremonies, and what is their purpose?**

#### **Daily Stand-ups**
A short daily meeting where team members share:
- What they did yesterday  
- What they will do today  
- Any blockers they have  

The purpose is to keep everyone aligned and identify problems early.

#### **Sprint Planning (Scrum) vs. Continuous Prioritization (Kanban)**

**Sprint Planning (Scrum):**  
Teams plan the work for the next sprint (usually 1–2 weeks).  
The goal is to decide what tasks can be completed within the sprint.

**Continuous Prioritization (Kanban):**  
There are no sprints.  
The team updates priorities whenever needed, and new tasks enter the board anytime.  
This is more flexible and fits asynchronous teams.

#### **Retrospectives**
A meeting where the team reflects on:
- What went well  
- What did not go well  
- What improvements can be made  

The purpose is continuous improvement.

#### **Backlog Refinement**
A process where the Product Manager and team review, update, or break tasks into smaller parts.  
This keeps the backlog clean and ready for development.

### **2. How do Agile teams collaborate asynchronously and across time zones?**

Agile teams collaborate asynchronously by using:
- Kanban boards to show clear task status  
- Daily updates through tools like Discord or Slack  
- Clear documentation  
- Written standup summaries  
- Recorded videos when needed  
- Shared notes for retrospectives and planning  

This allows team members in different time zones to stay aligned without meeting at the same time.

## 📝 Reflection

### **3. How do Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment?**

Agile ceremonies provide regular check-ins and structured communication.  
Stand-ups show what everyone is working on.  
Retrospectives allow honest discussion about improvements.  
Backlog refinement ensures the team understands the work clearly.

These ceremonies help teams stay aligned, avoid misunderstandings, and deliver work more smoothly.

### **4. Which ceremony do you think is most important for your role, and why?**

For me as a **Backend Intern**, the most important ceremony is the **Daily Stand-up**.

It helps me:
- Share my progress  
- Ask questions early  
- Identify blockers  
- Understand what other team members are doing  

Since the internship is remote and asynchronous, daily updates help me stay connected and avoid working in isolation.

## 🛠️ Task

### **5. Attend a stand-up meeting and observe how updates are shared.**

I attended a stand-up meeting and saw how team members share their updates in a short and clear way.  
Each person mentions what they finished, what they are doing next, and any blockers they need help with.

### **6. Participate in a retrospective or review past notes from one.**

I reviewed retrospective notes from previous Focus Bear meetings.  
I learned how the team uses feedback to improve processes, fix communication gaps, and keep workflows smooth.

### **7. Document one change you can make to improve your team collaboration.**

One change I can make is to **give clearer and more frequent written updates** on Discord.  
This helps the team understand my progress even if we are not online at the same time.  
It also reduces delays caused by time zone differences.
