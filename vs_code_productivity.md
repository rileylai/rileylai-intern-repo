## 📝 Reflection

### **1. Which shortcuts will be the most useful in your daily work?**

I think the shortcuts for editing will be the most useful for me, especially multiple cursors and selecting repeated words. I often need to update many lines at the same time when working on backend code, so these shortcuts help me move faster and avoid doing the same action again and again. The quick file search is also helpful because I can jump to any file without wasting time looking through folders.

### **2. How can keyboard shortcuts improve your productivity?**

Keyboard shortcuts help me work faster because I do not need to use the mouse all the time. When I keep my hands on the keyboard, I can stay focused and continue coding without breaking my flow. Shortcuts also reduce small mistakes, because actions like commenting, switching files, or opening the terminal become very quick and controlled. Over time, these small improvements add up and save a lot of time during a workday.
