# Terminal Client Setup & My Reflections

This document answers all questions from the “Set up a terminal client” onboarding task, in the same order as shown in the issue.

---

## 1. Which terminal client did you choose? Why?

I chose **iTerm2 + zsh** on my Mac.  
I picked iTerm2 because it feels faster and smoother than the default Terminal.  
It also has useful features like split windows, better search, and easier customization.  
I chose zsh because it gives better autocomplete, suggestions, and plugin support.

## 2. What customizations (if any) did you make?

I made a few simple customizations:

- **Theme:** I switched to a dark theme because it is comfortable for long working hours.  
- **Aliases:** I added short commands like `gs` for `git status` and `gp` for `git push`.  
- **Plugins:** I installed **Oh My Zsh**, which gives helpful prompts, colors, and suggestions.  
- **Prompt style:** I changed my prompt so I can easily see my current directory and Git branch.

These changes make the terminal easier to use and help me work faster.

## 3. What was the most useful command you learned today?

The most useful command I learned today is:

```
cd -
```

It lets me jump back to my previous directory with one command.  
This is helpful when switching between two folders during development.

I also practiced other important commands like:

```
ls       # list files
pwd      # show current path
mkdir    # create a folder
touch    # create a file
```

These commands make me more comfortable using the terminal every day.
