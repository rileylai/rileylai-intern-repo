# Learning Goals


### **1. What do you hope to learn from this internship?**
I hope to learn how real companies build and maintain production-level backend systems. I want to understand how developers work together, how tasks are organised, and how features move from planning to deployment. I also hope to learn practical skills that I cannot get from university, such as writing cleaner code, handling real bugs, and improving system reliability.

I am also interested in learning how enterprise-scale systems handle security, performance, and scalability. I want to understand how a real product protects user data, manages large traffic, and stays stable in difficult situations. These are skills I really want to build through this internship.

### **2. What skills are you most excited to develop?**
I am most excited to develop my backend engineering skills, especially around API design, testing, and debugging. I also want to learn more about Agile workflows, writing documentation, and improving communication with teammates.

Besides the backend part, I really hope to have a chance to work on the AI features in Focus Bear, especially the part that uses AI to decide which websites are allowed or aligned with the user’s goals. I want to understand how this system works and hopefully help build or improve some of these AI-related functions. I feel excited to see how both backend and AI features can support users in their daily habits.

### **3. What do you think you can contribute to the team?**
I can contribute strong motivation and a willingness to learn. I always try to finish tasks carefully and ask questions when I do not understand. I can also bring my experience from university projects, where I worked with microservices, databases, and cloud services. I believe I can support the team by taking responsibility for tasks and improving step by step.

### **4. What is one area you feel less confident in that you’d like to improve?**
I feel less confident in writing automated tests and debugging large codebases. Sometimes I need more time to understand complex logic. I want to improve my confidence by practicing more, learning from mentors, and understanding how to use tools like logs, breakpoints, and test frameworks. This will make me more independent as a backend engineer.

### **5. What does success in this internship look like for you?**
For me, success means building real features that provide value to Focus Bear and its users. It also means improving my technical skills and becoming more confident when working on tasks. If by the end of the internship I can handle backend issues on my own, work smoothly with the team, and feel that I made meaningful contributions, then I will consider this internship a success.
