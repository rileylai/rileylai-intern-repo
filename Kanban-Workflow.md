# Kanban Workflow and How I Use It

This document answers all questions from the Agile Workflows & Kanban onboarding task.

## 🔍 Research & Learn

### **1. How does a Kanban board work, and how does it help manage workflow?**

A Kanban board shows the status of work using columns.  
Each task moves from left to right as it progresses.  
This makes the workflow easy to understand, reduces confusion, and helps the team see what is important.

Kanban helps manage workflow by giving a clear visual view of what is being done, what is blocked, and what is finished.

---

### **2. What do the different columns on a Kanban board represent?**

A common Kanban board includes these columns:

- **Backlog / To Do** – Tasks that are planned but not started  
- **In Progress** – Tasks currently being worked on  
- **Blocked** – Tasks that cannot continue because something is missing  
- **Ready for Review** – Work that needs checking or approval  
- **Done** – Finished tasks  

Each column shows the life cycle of work.

---

### **3. How do tasks move through the board, and who is responsible for updating them?**

A task moves step by step:

1. **Backlog → In Progress** when work begins  
2. **In Progress → Review** when the task is completed  
3. **Review → Done** after approval  

The person doing the task is responsible for updating it.  
This ensures the board always reflects the real situation.

### **4. What are the benefits of limiting work in progress (WIP)?**

Limiting WIP helps:

- Reduce overload  
- Improve focus  
- Prevent too many half-finished tasks  
- Increase flow efficiency  
- Make the team finish tasks faster  

When fewer tasks are active, the overall workflow becomes smoother.

## 📝 Reflection

### **5. How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?**

Kanban shows priorities clearly by placing important tasks at the top of the board.  
Because WIP limits prevent too many tasks from being started, I can focus on one thing at a time.  
This avoids stress and helps keep work under control.

---

### **6. How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?**

I can improve my workflow by:

- Updating task status immediately  
- Working on fewer tasks at the same time  
- Checking for blockers early  
- Reviewing the board daily to understand priorities  

These habits help me stay organized and productive.

## 🛠️ Task

### **7. Create a Kanban board for your repo**

I created a Kanban board using GitHub Projects for my intern repo.  
The columns are:

- Not Started  
- In Progress  
- Ready for Review  
- Approved (By Bot)  
- Done  

This matches the recommended structure for the internship.

---

### **8. Move at least one task through the Kanban process and update its status correctly.**

I moved one of my onboarding tasks across the board:

- From **Not Started**  
→ **In Progress**  
→ **Done**

This helped me understand how the flow works.

### **9. Identify one way you can improve task tracking in your role.**

I can improve task tracking by **adding clearer task descriptions and linking related issues**.  
This helps me understand requirements better and makes reviewing easier for mentors.
