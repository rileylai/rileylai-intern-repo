## 🔍 Research & Learn

### **1. What are the key roles in an Agile team, and what does each role do?**

#### **Developers**
Developers build the product. They write code, fix bugs, review pull requests, and deliver features based on user stories. They work closely with the team to create working software.

#### **QA (Quality Assurance)**
QA ensures the quality of the product. They design tests, find bugs, confirm functionality, and help maintain high standards. Their goal is to make sure the user experience is smooth.

#### **Product Manager (PM)**
The PM defines what needs to be built and why. They prioritize features, understand user needs, and maintain the product vision. They also help the team understand requirements clearly.

#### **Agile Project Manager (Agile PM)**
The Agile PM helps the team work efficiently. They remove blockers, support planning, and ensure the team follows Agile practices. Their goal is to support productivity and communication.

#### **Other Supporting Roles (Stakeholders, UX, Customer Support)**
These roles help the team by giving feedback, reporting issues, and improving the overall user experience.  
- UX designers improve usability  
- Customer support shares user problems  
- Stakeholders guide business needs

### **2. How do these roles collaborate in Kanban vs. Scrum?**

#### **Scrum**
- Collaboration happens inside sprints  
- Developers, QA, and PM work according to sprint goals  
- Daily standups, sprint planning, reviews, and retrospectives  
- Clear rhythm and structured team ceremonies  

#### **Kanban**
- Work flows continuously with no sprints  
- Roles collaborate anytime when a task moves across the board  
- QA and Dev work closely to finish tasks quickly  
- PM updates priorities on the board when needed  
- Less ceremony, more flexibility

## 📝 Reflection

### **3. What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?**

I am a **Backend Intern**.  
My role contributes to the Agile process by building backend features that support the product.  
I implement APIs, handle database operations, fix bugs, and improve system performance.  
By delivering small pieces of working software, I help the team move tasks across the Kanban board and make continuous progress.

### **4. How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?**

My work interacts with many roles:

- **With PM:** I read requirements and clarify user stories so I know what backend features to build.  
- **With Developers:** I collaborate on technical design, code reviews, and debugging.  
- **With QA:** I support testing by fixing bugs quickly and giving clear explanations of backend logic.  
- **With UX / Frontend:** I provide the APIs and data they need to display correct information to users.  

These interactions help our Agile team deliver value smoothly.

## 🛠️ Task

### **5. Write a short description of how your role fits into the Agile team.**

As a Backend Intern, I help turn product ideas into real backend features.  
I break down tasks into small parts, build APIs, maintain the database, and ensure the logic is correct.  
My work supports the whole team and helps move tasks from “In Progress” to “Done” on the Kanban board.

### **6. Identify one other role you frequently collaborate with and describe how you can improve teamwork with them.**

I frequently collaborate with **Frontend Developers**.  
To improve teamwork, I can:

- Provide clearer API documentation  
- Communicate changes early  
- Give example data for testing  
- Ask for feedback to improve API design  

Good communication helps us deliver features faster and avoid misunderstandings.
