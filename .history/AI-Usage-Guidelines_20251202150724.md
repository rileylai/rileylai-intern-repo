## 🔍 Research & Learn

### **1. What AI tools are typically used for your role?**

As a Backend Intern, I commonly use AI tools for:
- Code generation (small helper functions or boilerplate code)  
- Debugging and error explanation  
- Improving documentation and comments  
- Writing reflections or summaries  
- Learning new technologies quickly  

AI helps me work faster, but I still need to understand the code myself.

### **2. What are the benefits and risks of using AI in a professional setting?**

**Benefits:**
- Saves time on repetitive tasks  
- Helps understand new concepts  
- Improves writing and documentation  
- Gives quick examples or starter code  

**Risks:**
- AI can generate incorrect information  
- Sensitive data may leak if entered into AI tools  
- Over-reliance can reduce independent thinking  
- Code might not follow company guidelines  

This is why AI must be used carefully and responsibly.

---

### **3. What types of information should never be entered into AI tools?**

You should never enter:
- Passwords or access tokens  
- API keys  
- Company internal documents  
- Confidential business information  
- Client or user data  
- Personal information (yours or others’)  

AI tools are not always private, so sensitive data must be protected.

### **4. How can you fact-check and validate AI-generated content to ensure accuracy?**

You can:
- Read the output carefully  
- Compare it with official documentation  
- Test AI-generated code before using it  
- Ask team members to review important content  
- Check multiple sources online  

Critical thinking must always be used when working with AI.

## 📝 Reflection

### **5. When should you use AI for assistance, and when should you rely on your own skills?**

I should use AI for:
- Research  
- Learning new ideas  
- Getting suggestions  
- Checking grammar or improving writing  

I should rely on my own skills for:
- Understanding backend logic  
- Debugging real issues  
- Making technical decisions  
- Writing important code for production  

AI should support my work, not replace my thinking.

---

### **6. How can you avoid over-reliance on AI while still benefiting from it?**

I can:
- Always try to solve the problem myself first  
- Use AI only to confirm or refine my answer  
- Study the explanation behind AI’s suggestions  
- Limit AI use for critical areas  
- Review and rewrite the code in my own style  

This helps me grow as a developer while still using AI efficiently.

---

### **7. What steps will you take to ensure data privacy when using AI tools?**

I will:
- Never paste confidential information into AI  
- Avoid sharing real API keys or sensitive logs  
- Use dummy data when asking AI for help  
- Follow Focus Bear’s privacy guidelines  
- Double-check before uploading any content  

This helps protect both user data and company security.

## 🛠️ Task

### **8. Identify one task you can improve using an AI tool, and try it out.**

I used AI to help improve my writing for this Markdown document.  
It helped me organize information and make the content clearer.

---

### **9. Review the AI-generated output critically—did it require editing or fact-checking?**

Yes.  
I reviewed all AI-generated content to make sure it was accurate and simple.  
I also made small edits to match my own writing style and to ensure correctness.

---

### **10. Document one best practice you will follow when using AI tools at Focus Bear.**

My best practice:  
**I will always verify AI output with official documentation before using it in code or work tasks.**

This ensures accuracy and reduces the chance of mistakes.
