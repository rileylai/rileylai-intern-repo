# Introduction to Unit Testing with Jest — Reflection

This document explains why automated testing is important and what challenges I faced when writing my first Jest test.

## 1. Why is automated testing important in software development?

Automated testing is important because:

1. It helps catch bugs early before code goes to production.
2. It prevents old features from breaking when new code is added.
3. It gives confidence when refactoring or changing code.
4. It saves time compared to manual testing.
5. It improves overall code quality and reliability.

With tests, developers can make changes more safely.

## 2. What did you find challenging when writing your first Jest test?

When writing my first Jest test, I found it challenging to:

1. Understand the Jest syntax such as `describe`, `test`, and `expect`.
2. Know how to structure test files correctly.
3. Decide what should be tested and what should not.
4. Debug failing tests and read error messages.
5. Set up the test environment correctly in the project.

After practicing, these challenges became easier to handle.

## Summary

Unit testing with Jest helps ensure code works as expected.  
Although writing the first test can be confusing, it becomes easier with practice and improves development confidence.
