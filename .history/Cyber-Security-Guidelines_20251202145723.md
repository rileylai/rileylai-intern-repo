# Cyber Security Guidelines and Reflections

This document answers all questions from the Cyber Security task.

## 🔍 Research & Learn

### **1. What are common cyber security threats in a remote work environment?**

Common threats include:
- Phishing emails pretending to be official messages  
- Malware from insecure downloads  
- Password theft  
- Unsafe Wi-Fi networks  
- Social engineering attacks  

Remote work increases risks because people connect from home or public networks.

---

### **2. What are best practices for keeping your devices and accounts secure?**

Good practices include:
- Keeping software updated  
- Using strong and unique passwords  
- Enabling two-factor authentication  
- Avoiding unknown links or attachments  
- Using secure Wi-Fi with a password  
- Locking your device when not using it  

---

### **3. Why is it important to lock your computer when away from your desk?**

Locking your computer prevents anyone from seeing sensitive information or accessing your accounts.  
Even if you step away for a short time, leaving your device unlocked is a major security risk.

---

### **4. How should you handle phishing attempts and suspicious links?**

You should:
- Not click the link  
- Check the sender’s address  
- Look for spelling mistakes or unusual requests  
- Report the message  
- Delete it immediately  

If you are not sure, always verify with the official team.

---

### **5. What makes a strong password, and why should you use a password manager?**

A strong password:
- Has at least 12 characters  
- Includes numbers, symbols, upper and lower case letters  
- Is not related to personal information  

A password manager helps create and store strong passwords so you never reuse the same one.

---

### **6. Why is two-factor authentication (2FA) important, and when should you enable it?**

2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code or device confirmation.  
Even if someone steals your password, they cannot log in without your second factor.

You should enable 2FA for:
- Email  
- Bank accounts  
- Work accounts  
- Cloud storage  
- Any important service

## 📝 Reflection

### **7. What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?**

I already:
- Use unique passwords  
- Enable 2FA on most accounts  
- Keep my Mac updated  
- Avoid unknown links  

I can improve by:
- Using a password manager for every account  
- Being more careful with public Wi-Fi  
- Locking my laptop every time I step away  

---

### **8. How can you make secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?**

I can make it a habit by:
- Setting auto-lock on my laptop  
- Using a password manager daily  
- Always checking links before clicking  
- Doing regular security checks once a month  

These small routines help security become part of my normal workflow.

---

### **9. What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?**

I will:
- Update weak passwords  
- Switch to a password manager  
- Enable 2FA on all important accounts  
- Avoid using the same password anywhere  

This reduces the risk of account theft.

---

### **10. What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?**

I would:
1. Change my password immediately  
2. Enable or re-check 2FA  
3. Log out from all devices  
4. Review recent activity  
5. Report it to the team if it’s a work account  

Acting quickly helps protect data and prevent further damage.

## 🛠️ Task

### **11. Ensure your work accounts have strong passwords and enable 2FA where possible.**

I updated my passwords and checked that 2FA is enabled on the work accounts.

---

### **12. Review your password storage method.**

I started using a password manager to store and generate secure passwords.

---

### **13. Set up auto-lock on your computer and phone.**

My laptop now auto-locks after a few minutes of inactivity.

---

### **14. Document one new cyber security habit you will follow at Focus Bear.**

My new habit:  
**I will always verify the sender before opening any link or attachment, even if it looks official.**
