## 🔍 Research & Learn

### **1. What is Agile, and how does it differ from traditional project management?**

Agile is a way of working that focuses on flexibility, fast feedback, and continuous improvement.  
Work is delivered in small parts so the team can learn quickly and change direction when needed.

Traditional project management (Waterfall) plans everything at the beginning and follows a strict, fixed process.  
If something changes, the whole plan becomes difficult to adjust.

**Key difference:**  
- **Agile:** flexible, adaptive, and iterative  
- **Traditional:** fixed plan, heavy documentation, harder to change

### **2. What are the core values and principles of Agile?**  
*(From the Agile Manifesto)*

**Four Values:**
1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools  
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation  
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation  
4. Responding to change over following a plan  

**Simplified meaning:**  
People, teamwork, and learning are more important than strict rules.

### **3. What are the differences between Scrum and Kanban, and when is each used?**

#### **Scrum**
- Uses sprints (usually 1–2 weeks)  
- Has fixed roles: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team  
- Sprint planning, review, and retrospective  
- Good for teams that need structure and clear sprint goals  

#### **Kanban**
- No sprints  
- Continuous flow of work  
- Work moves from “To Do → Doing → Done”  
- Limits how many tasks can be in progress  
- Good for teams that need flexibility or work async  

#### **When each is used**
- **Scrum:** good for stable teams working on planned features  
- **Kanban:** good for changing priorities, async teams, or continuous work

### **4. Why does Focus Bear lean towards Kanban instead of Scrum?**

Focus Bear prefers Kanban because:

- The team works **asynchronously** across different time zones  
- Workloads and priorities can change quickly  
- Kanban allows smooth, continuous flow without sprint pressure  
- It is simpler and more flexible for interns joining at different times  
- It reduces stress because there are no strict sprint deadlines  

Overall, Kanban fits the remote and flexible nature of the company.

## 📝 Reflection

### **5. What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?**

**Benefits:**
- Faster feedback and improvement  
- Clear communication with the team  
- Easier to adapt when priorities change  
- Helps reduce risk by delivering small pieces of work  

**Challenges:**
- Needs strong self-management  
- Priorities may change often  
- Can be hard for beginners to estimate tasks  
- Requires consistent communication

### **6. How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?**

Agile helps me by:

- Encouraging me to communicate clearly with my team  
- Allowing me to change direction quickly when feedback comes  
- Helping me break tasks into smaller steps so I can focus better  
- Supporting continuous improvement, especially as an intern  

Agile makes it easier to work remotely and still stay aligned with the team.

## 🛠️ Task

### **7. Summarize the main differences between Scrum and Kanban in your own words.**

Scrum uses fixed sprints with strong structure and defined roles.  
Kanban is more flexible and works in a continuous flow without sprints.

Scrum is good for planned features with a stable team.  
Kanban is good for fast changes, remote teams, and ongoing tasks.

---

### **8. Identify one Agile principle that will be most useful in your work.**

The most useful Agile principle for me is:

### **“Responding to change over following a plan.”**

Because the internship is flexible and async, tasks may change often.  
This principle helps me stay calm, adapt quickly, and keep moving forward.
