# When You Get Stuck – What Next?

This document describes how I decide when to use Google, AI tools, or ask colleagues for help during problem-solving.

## 1. When do you prefer using AI vs. searching Google?

I usually choose different tools based on the situation.

I prefer using AI when:

- I want a quick explanation of a concept.
- I need help understanding error messages.
- I want example code or step-by-step guidance.
- I need to clarify my thinking or explore different solutions.

I prefer using Google when:

- I am looking for official documentation.
- I need very specific syntax or configuration details.
- I want to read discussions from multiple sources (e.g. Stack Overflow).
- I need up-to-date or tool-specific information.

Using both together often gives the best result.

## 2. How do you decide when to ask a colleague instead?

I decide to ask a colleague when:

- I have tried debugging by myself but am still stuck.
- The problem is related to project-specific logic.
- I am not sure if my approach matches team standards.
- The issue may affect other parts of the system.
- The task is urgent and blocking progress.

Before asking, I try to clearly explain what I have already tried.

## 3. What challenges do developers face when troubleshooting alone?

When troubleshooting alone, developers may face these challenges:

1. Spending too much time stuck on one problem.
2. Missing simple mistakes due to tunnel vision.
3. Feeling frustrated or losing confidence.
4. Not knowing whether the solution is correct or best practice.
5. Lacking feedback on design or approach.

Asking for help at the right time can save time and improve learning.

## Summary

When I get stuck, I first try to understand the problem on my own.  
Then I use Google or AI tools depending on the situation.  
If the issue is complex or blocking, I ask a colleague for help.

Using the right support at the right time makes problem-solving more efficient.
