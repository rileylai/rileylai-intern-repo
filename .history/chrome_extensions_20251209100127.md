# Dev Productivity Chrome Extensions

This document answers all questions from the “Set up dev productivity chrome extensions” onboarding task.

---

## 1. Which extensions did you install? Why?

I installed all the recommended extensions:

### **React Developer Tools**
I installed this because it helps me inspect React components.  
I can see props, state, and the component tree more clearly, which is very useful when working on frontend debugging.

### **Redux DevTools**
I chose this because it allows me to check Redux state changes step by step.  
Even though I am mainly focused on backend work, understanding frontend state flow helps me communicate better with teammates.

### **A JSON Viewer**
I installed this to make API responses easier to read.  
It formats the JSON output so I can quickly understand the data structure without scrolling through messy text.

### **Lighthouse**
I installed Lighthouse because it helps check performance, accessibility, and best practices.  
It is useful when testing web pages or learning how websites can be improved.

## 2. What was the most useful thing you learned?

The most useful thing I learned is how much time these tools can save during debugging.  
Before installing them, I had to inspect data manually or log many details in the console.  
Now, with React DevTools and JSON Viewer, I can see structured information instantly.  
Lighthouse also taught me how to evaluate performance and understand what affects loading speed.
