# Competitive Landscape Analysis


## Research Summary

### Freedom
A cross-platform blocker that lets users block websites, apps, or even the entire Internet. It supports macOS, Windows, iOS, Android and ChromeOS, so blocks apply across all user devices. 

Freedom allows custom blocklists, recurring or scheduled sessions, and a “Locked Mode” that prevents users from ending a block session early. 

It also supports blocking entire internet, or block systems across devices, useful for “digital detox” or deep-focus work. 

### Cold Turkey
A strong blocker for desktop (Windows, macOS). It can block websites, apps, or even the entire computer to help users avoid digital distractions. 

Cold Turkey supports a “Take a Break” mode (Pro version), which includes Pomodoro-style timers: the app alternates between blocking and allowing access so you get scheduled work sessions and breaks. 

It also offers “Allowances” — you are allowed to use blocked sites/apps until allowance time is used up; after that, block resumes. 

For stricter focus, Cold Turkey provides “locked block” features (hard lock, password protection, disabling task-manager, even blocking system time changes) — making it hard to bypass once a session starts.

### Tiimo
A different kind of productivity / planning app. It is a visual planner designed to support people with difficulties in organization, like people with ADHD or other executive-functioning needs. 

Tiimo uses a visual timeline, color-coded schedule, icons, and even AI-based planning/co-planner features. It helps users turn tasks into realistic, manageable daily plans.

It also offers routines, to-do lists, focus timer, and sometimes widgets to help users see what’s next. 

Tiimo is built with neurodiversity in mind, aiming to help users with attention or executive-function challenges.

There are many other focus / blocker apps in the market (not part of this list), but the above represent two big classes: strict blockers (Freedom, Cold Turkey) and planning/routine helpers (Tiimo).

According to a comparison article from the company behind our app, our product — Focus Bear — is presented as a hybrid: distraction blocker + habit & routine helper + breaks & focus-modes.

Focus Bear can support cross-device blocking, habit stacking, configurable break timers, multiple focus modes, and more “holistic” productivity support beyond just blocking distractions.

## Reflection

### **1. What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?**
I think Focus Bear is different because it tries to combine blocking distractions with building good habits and routines. Unlike pure blockers (like Freedom or Cold Turkey), Focus Bear seems to aim not only to stop you from wasting time, but also to help you build structure: daily routines, break timers, habit-building. Also, compared with a planner like Tiimo, Focus Bear adds blocking capability — so it is not just about planning tasks, but also about controlling environment (reducing distraction) and improving discipline.

### **2. If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?***

If I were a user who sometimes struggles both with planning my day and with staying focused, I might choose Focus Bear because it offers a more complete support system. With Focus Bear, I don’t need separate apps for blocking distractions, for setting routines, and for organizing tasks/habits — I can have everything in one place. That makes it simpler and more convenient. Also, if Focus Bear supports cross-device use and better user experience (compared to strict and sometimes harsh blockers), that could make it more comfortable for daily long-term use.

### **3. What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?**
Some apps like Cold Turkey Blocker provide built-in Pomodoro / break-allowance cycles: when you start a block session, Cold Turkey can alternate blocking and allowing access — e.g. 25 minutes of work + 5 minutes break, or allow limited access until allowance is used up. 

Other apps like Tiimo offer very advanced visualization and planning features: Tiimo has a visual schedule planner (with color-coded daily overview, drag-and-drop tasks) and an AI co-planner to help users create and prioritize tasks. 

Tiimo also supports real-time, glanceable reminders and progress tracking: with widgets, live activities, and Dynamic Island / lock-screen / home-screen timers, the user can see focus timers and upcoming tasks without opening the app. 

Because of these features, apps like Cold Turkey or Tiimo may provide more structured cycles of work + rest (through break timers) or better visual and planning support than Focus Bear — depending on what features Focus Bear currently offers.

### **4. Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?**
Offer integrated Pomodoro / structured work-break cycles, where Focus Bear automatically switches between “focus mode” (blocking distractions) and “break/allowance mode” (allowing sites/apps) by timer. This gives a balance between discipline and rest.
