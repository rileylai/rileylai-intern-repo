## 🛠️ Git Installation

I installed Git on my system and confirmed it with:

```
git --version
```

The installation was successful, and I can now use Git from the command line.

## 🧰 Git Client Choice

I decided to use **GitHub Desktop** because it is easy to understand and gives me a clear view of my commits and branches.  
I also use **Git inside VS Code** when I want to commit quickly while coding.  
Both tools help me stay organised and avoid mistakes.

## 📝 Reflection

### **1. Have you used Git before? In what context?**

Yes, I have used Git before in my university projects and personal backend work.  
I mainly used it to manage versions, switch branches, and push updates to GitHub.  
But I still want to improve my understanding so I can work better in a real team environment.

---

### **2. Which Git client did you choose? Why?**

I chose **GitHub Desktop** because it is simple and beginner-friendly.  
It helps me see my changes clearly, and it reduces the chance of making mistakes.  
I also use **VS Code Git** because it feels natural while coding.

---

### **3. What was the most interesting thing you learned about Git today?**

The most interesting thing I learned is how Git helps developers track every change and recover old versions anytime.  
I also understood how branches make teamwork easier because everyone can work separately and then merge changes together.
