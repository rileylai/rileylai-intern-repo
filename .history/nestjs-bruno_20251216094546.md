# API Debugging with Bruno

This document answers all questions from the API debugging with Bruno onboarding task.

## 🔍 Research & Learn

### **1. How does Bruno help with API testing compared to Postman or cURL?**

Bruno is:

- **Lightweight and fast**
- **File-based**, storing collections as plain text for easy version control
- **Open-source**, with no cloud sync or account required
- **Developer-friendly**, using a simple folder structure for API collections

Compared to cURL:

- Bruno provides a visual UI instead of long command-line scripts
- Requests can be saved, organized, and reused

Compared to Postman:

- Bruno uses local files instead of heavy cloud sync
- No login required
- Faster performance for daily backend debugging

### **2. How do you send an authenticated request in Bruno?**

You can send authenticated requests by:

- Adding a **Bearer token** in the `Authorization` header
- Storing tokens in Bruno’s **Environment Variables**
- Creating a reusable **Auth folder** with pre-filled headers
- Passing custom headers (e.g., `x-api-key`, `Authorization`) directly in the request editor

This makes it easy to test protected NestJS endpoints.

### **3. What are the advantages of organizing API requests in collections?**

Collections allow you to:

- Group endpoints by feature (Auth, Users, Admin, Tasks, etc.)
- Reuse variables such as URLs, tokens, and IDs
- Share a consistent structure across your team
- Track changes in Git because collections are text files
- Speed up debugging by keeping all API requests in one place

Collections make API testing easier, cleaner, and more maintainable.

### **4. How would you structure a Bruno collection for a NestJS backend project?**

Recommended structure:

- `Auth/` — login, refresh token, signup
- `Users/` — get profile, update user, delete user
- `Admin/` — admin-only actions
- `Tasks/` — CRUD endpoints
- `Health/` — health check, status
- `Environments/` — local, staging, production variables

This mirrors the backend’s feature modules, making debugging simple and intuitive.
