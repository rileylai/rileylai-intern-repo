# Connecting to PostgreSQL with TypeORM in NestJS — Reflection

This document explains how TypeORM integrates with NestJS, how entities and repositories work, and why PostgreSQL is a strong choice for backend development.

## 1. How does `@nestjs/typeorm` simplify database interactions?

`@nestjs/typeorm` makes working with the database easier because:

1. It gives a clean way to set up database connections inside NestJS.
2. It integrates well with NestJS modules, so everything stays organised.
3. It allows dependency injection for repositories, so I can use them directly in services.
4. It reduces boilerplate — I don’t need to write raw SQL for common operations.
5. It follows NestJS’ architecture, making the code consistent and predictable.

Overall, it lets me work with PostgreSQL in a more structured and readable way.

## 2. What is the difference between an entity and a repository in TypeORM?

### **Entity**

- Represents a database table.
- Defines the columns and their types.
- Maps TypeScript classes to real PostgreSQL rows.

### **Repository**

- Provides functions to read and write data.
- Handles queries like `find`, `save`, `delete`, and custom queries.
- Uses the entity’s structure to interact with the database.

**In short:**  
**Entity = the shape of the data.**  
**Repository = the tool that performs operations on that data.**

## 3. How does TypeORM handle migrations in a NestJS project?

TypeORM handles migrations by:

1. Generating migration files that record schema changes.
2. Applying migrations using CLI commands such as `migration:run`.
3. Allowing rollback with `migration:revert`.
4. Keeping schema updates version-controlled so every developer stays in sync.
5. Making sure changes apply automatically when the app is deployed.

This helps avoid manual SQL work and reduces schema inconsistency across environments.

## 4. What are the advantages of using PostgreSQL over other databases in a NestJS app?

PostgreSQL is a strong choice because:

1. It supports advanced relational features that TypeORM uses well.
2. It handles structured data and relationships cleanly.
3. It is stable, reliable, and widely used in production systems.
4. It has strong JSON support, which works well for modern API apps.
5. It integrates smoothly with Docker and cloud platforms.
6. It gives better control over queries compared to many NoSQL databases.

For a backend like Focus Bear’s, PostgreSQL provides both flexibility and performance.

## Summary

Using TypeORM with NestJS makes database work easier and more consistent.  
Entities define the data shape, repositories handle CRUD, migrations track schema changes, and PostgreSQL provides a solid foundation for reliable backend development.
