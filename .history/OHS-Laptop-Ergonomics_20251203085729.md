## 🔍 Research & Learn

### **1. What are the risks of using a laptop without an external monitor or keyboard?**

Using a laptop alone often forces you to look downward and reach forward. This can lead to neck strain, rounded shoulders, lower-back pain, wrist discomfort, and eye fatigue. Over long periods, these poor postures increase the risk of repetitive strain injuries and long-term musculoskeletal problems.

### **2. What ergonomic equipment can improve posture when working on a laptop?**
Helpful equipment includes:
- Laptop stand  
- External keyboard & mouse  
- Ergonomic chair  
- Footrest  
- External monitor  
---

### **3. What adjustments should be made to monitor height, chair position, and desk setup for a healthier workspace?**
- Monitor height: top of the screen at or slightly below eye level  
- Monitor distance: about one arm’s length  
- Chair: hips slightly above knees, back supported, feet flat  
- Desk: keyboard and mouse at elbow height, shoulders relaxed  
- Laptop: raised on a stand

### **4. What are some daily habits that reduce the impact of prolonged laptop use?**
- Movement breaks every 30–60 minutes  
- Posture resets  
- 20-20-20 eye rule  
- Stretching  
- Alternate sitting/standing  
- Adjust lighting and brightness

## 📝 Reflection

### **5. What equipment changes can you make to improve your workspace setup?**

I can use a laptop stand, external keyboard, and external mouse to keep my neck neutral and reduce back and wrist strain.

### **6. What behavioural changes can you implement to improve posture and reduce strain?**

I will sit upright, avoid leaning forward, take movement breaks, stretch regularly, and follow the 20-20-20 eye rule.

### **7. How can you remind yourself to maintain good posture and take breaks throughout the day?**

I will use Focus Bear’s built-in movement and posture reminders to stay consistent during work.
