## 🔹 How I Work Best

I do my best work when:
- I have clear goals and a structured task list  
- I can focus without interruptions  
- I understand the purpose behind the task  
- I follow step-by-step workflows  
- There is a realistic timeline or deadline  

I struggle when:

## 🔹 Communication Style

I prefer messages to be:
- Clear and specific  
- Short and direct  
- Written rather than verbal when possible  
- Async-friendly (I read messages and respond quickly during work hours)

The best way to reach me is:
- Discord for daily updates or questions  
- Email if it is not urgent  
- Scheduled calls for deeper discussions  

If you need something urgent, please send a Discord message with **“URGENT”** in the first line.

## 🔹 Collaboration & Teamwork

I work best in a team when:
- Everyone communicates openly and clearly  
- Each member updates progress regularly  
- People help each other when someone gets stuck  

My biggest pet peeve in teamwork is:
- Unclear responsibilities  
- Slow follow-ups that delay progress  
- Last-minute surprises without prior discussion  

If I seem quiet in a meeting, it usually means:
- I’m processing the information  
- I’m thinking deeply before giving an answer

## 🔹 Focus & Productivity

I stay focused by:
- Using Focus Bear sessions  
- Breaking tasks into small steps  
- Keeping a clean and distraction-free workspace  

Things that distract me:
- Constant context switching  
- Vague instructions  
- Noise or frequent interruptions  

The best way to support my productivity is:
- Give me clear task descriptions  
- Provide examples or expected output  
- Let me know priorities so I can plan my time  

---

## 🔹 Feedback & Growth

I like feedback to be:
- Direct, simple, and kind  
- With clear examples  
- Written if possible (so I can review it later)  

When I make a mistake, the best way to let me know is:
- Send me a short message explaining the issue  
- Let me know how I can fix or improve it  

I appreciate it when teammates:
- Share tips or shortcuts  
- Give suggestions for better code structure  
- Communicate openly if something is unclear

## 🔹 Fun Facts & Quirks

One thing people often misunderstand about me is:
- I may look serious when I’m focused or processing information, but I’m actually very friendly and always open to discussion.

A fun fact about me:
- I love coffee and I want to try every highly-recommended café in Sydney (where I study) and Melbourne (I’ll visit next year)!

My work superpower is:
- I learn quickly, and I enjoy digging deep into new knowledge — especially enterprise-scale best practices!
