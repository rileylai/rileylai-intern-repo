# AI Tools for Development

This document answers all questions from the “Set Up AI Tools for Development” onboarding task.

---

## 1. Which AI tools did you try?

I tried the following AI tools:

### **ChatGPT**
I used ChatGPT for asking coding questions and debugging small issues.  
It is very good at explaining concepts in a simple way, which helps me understand topics faster.

### **GitHub Copilot**
I installed GitHub Copilot in VS Code.  
It suggests code while I type, which helps me work faster and reduce repeated typing.

### **Claude**
I also tried Claude as an alternative AI assistant.  
Claude is good at giving detailed explanations and longer reasoning steps.

## 2. What worked well? What didn’t?

### ✅ What worked well

- **Code suggestions:**  
  GitHub Copilot helped me complete functions more quickly, especially when writing common patterns.

- **Debugging help:**  
  ChatGPT explained error messages clearly and helped me find the problem step by step.

- **Learning new concepts:**  
  Claude and ChatGPT both explained topics in simple language, which made learning easier.

### ❌ What didn’t work well

- **Copilot sometimes guesses wrong:**  
  Sometimes Copilot suggested code that did not match what I wanted, so I still needed to check carefully.

- **AI answers can be too general:**  
  When the question is unclear, AI tools may give broad answers that are not very helpful.

- **Needs human review:**  
  AI suggestions are good, but I still must understand the code myself to avoid mistakes.

## 3. When do you think AI is most useful for coding?

I think AI is most useful in these situations:

- When I want to **understand a new concept** quickly.  
- When I need help **debugging**, especially for simple mistakes.  
- When writing **repeated or boilerplate code** that does not need much thinking.  
- When I want to **learn different ways to solve a problem** by comparing AI suggestions.

AI is less useful for tasks that require deep system understanding or detailed architecture decisions, because those still need my own thinking.

## 4. Experiments I tried

### **• Generating code snippets**
I asked AI to generate simple functions, and it helped me save time.  
It also taught me shortcuts I didn’t know before.

### **• Debugging a simple problem**
I used ChatGPT to fix an error in a basic JavaScript function.  
It explained the problem clearly and helped me understand why the error happened.

### **• Asking AI to explain a new concept**
I asked AI to explain “debouncing” in frontend development.  
The explanation was simple and easy for me to understand.
